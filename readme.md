# Teaparty with a TeaRex 🦖

### Learn more about tea by playing a Jump'n'Run game 

Collect the tea leaves and necessary items to make different kinds of tea. Every level is different and what you need to collect or avoid collecting changes. Play it until the end to see a super cute picture of a TeaRex! 

This was a fun little project during my bootcamp to understand more about the basics of OOP. It's built mainly with JavaScript and uses the P5 library to render everything. 

#### How to play

Simply clone the repo, open the file tearex-game.html in your browser and you're set to go!

Enjoy and keep drinking tea 🍵🌱
